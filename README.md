# CO2

This is a very basic script to connect to several CO2 sensors and record the data to a csv. 

The sensors are Aranet4s: https://aranet4.com/

I use a Raspberry Pi 3 running debian-based Raspberry Pi OS, but I can't see why any linux box with bluetooth shouldn't manage to work.

The Aranet4 python client is from here: https://github.com/Anrijs/Aranet4-Python

You will need to determine the MAC address of your own sensors if you use this script.
